# A-card-gameplay-inspired-color-image-encryption-scheme-driven-by-novel-2D-hyperchaotic-map

This repository implements and reproduces experiments for a card-gameplay-inspired permutation (cut/riffle/deal analogies) combined with a hyperchaos-driven diffusion pipeline for color image encryption. It includes end-to-end scripts and evaluators to support batch experiments and reproducibility.

Highlights

üÉè Card-gameplay permutation: Global shuffling via cut/riffle/deal-style mechanisms for strong spatial de-correlation.

üîÄ Hyperchaos-driven diffusion: Sensitive diffusion powered by a novel 2D hyperchaotic map, with transient removal and an automatic ‚Äúentry into typical behavior‚Äù detection.

üìä Security & statistics: One-click NPCR/UACI, entropy, pixel-correlation, key/plaintext sensitivity, and occlusion-attack robustness; NIST SP 800-22 randomness testing support.

üß™ Reproducibility: Experiment configs, convergence plots, and logs for reliable re-runs.

‚öôÔ∏è Modular design: Decoupled map generation, permutation, diffusion, and evaluation‚Äîeasy to swap components and run ablations.

Status (WIP)

The codebase is being organized. Coming soon: example data, transient/convergence demos, batch evaluation pipeline, and report templates.
